Thread 1 is created.
Thread 1 is holding mutexes: 
Thread 1  lock the mutex 2.
Thread 3 is created.
Thread 3 is holding mutexes: 
Thread 3  lock the mutex 0.
Thread 1 is created.
Thread 1 is holding mutexes: 2 
Deadlock is detected.
Thread 0 is holding mutexes: 
Thread 1 is holding mutexes: 2 
Thread 2 is holding mutexes: 
Thread 3 is holding mutexes: 0 

thread 1 lock a mutex 2 ......1
thread 3 lock a mutex 0 ......2
then thread 1 trying to lock a mutex 0 which is already held by Thread 3 ,creating a circular dependency among the threads' resource requests, resulting in a deadlock .

Note : it migh happen deadlock with the same input but with different thread depends on the time thread wait and the OS .
