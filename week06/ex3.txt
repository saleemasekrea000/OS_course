The shortest job first scheduler is more effective than the first-come-first-served (FCFS) scheduler 
because it minimizes waiting times for other processes. 
By selecting the shortest job first, it reduces the time other processes have to wait.
 In contrast, the FCFS algorithm may prioritize longer jobs, 
 leading to longer waiting times for other processes.
